Established in the Netherlands, our mission is to stand with those who have been silenced, particularly Egyptians who face political persecution in their homeland. Our foundation works tirelessly to defend human rights for all, with a special focus on supporting Egyptians residing in the Netherlands who have been affected by oppressive regimes. We strive to create a safe space that empowers those fleeing injustice to live with dignity and rebuild their lives. We are committed to organizing a variety of events and activities to shed light on human rights issues, from awareness campaigns to protests against dictatorship and repression. We aspire to be a beacon of change and urge the international community to take a clear stance in support of fundamental freedoms in Egypt and beyond. Through collaboration with our partners and the local and international community, we aim to achieve justice, promote democracy, and build a world where everyone has equal rights and opportunities"
